## 1. Get unstuck by using CPR

Get unstuck by spotting conversations that are keeping me from what I want, then unbundling them by talking about the "CPR" abbreviation.

* What results do I really want, for myself, for others, for the relationship, for the organization?

* How would I behave if I really did?


## 3. Master my stories

Master my stories -- even when I'm angry, scared, or hurt -- by separating facts from stories.

Skill: Tell the rest of the story by asking three questions.

* What am I pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? Watch out for any "victim" story.

* Why would a reasonable, rational, decent person do this? Watch out for any "villian" story.

* What should I do right now to move toward what I really want? Watch out for any "helpless" story.
